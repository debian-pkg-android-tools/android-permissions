android-permissions
-------------------

Android is based on the Linux kernel, but is not otherwise a UNIX operating
system. That means that Debian can be installed in parallel with Android,
using the same kernel as Android.  Android uses Linux users and groups quite
differently than GNU/Linux.  Each app has its own user account, and every part
of that app runs as that user. Linux groups are used to represent system
permissions, like internet access.  This package sets up all of the Android
persmissions groups in Debian so that you can easily give Debian processes
Android permissions by adding the user that process runs as to the group that
represented the permission.  Specifically, this package adds all groups for
each ID in Android's system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h
to /etc/group.

This is required in Debian+Android setups created by Android apps such as
Debian Kit[1] and Lil' Debi[2].

This package is based on Sven-Ola Tuecke's 'andromize' package[3].
